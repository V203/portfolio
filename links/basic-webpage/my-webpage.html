                                The reason I would want to visit rome is becuase of its rich historical value and its ancient warfare  political
                                strategies.The other thing about rome is that it is very religious city and they have a  Pope some kind of holy religious leader
                                who many nations look up to.

                        The reason I would want to learn latin is because if you would learn 
                        latin you would be able to understand some of the European languages
                        cause most of Eotropean languages are derived from latin.
                        The latin language is one of the most oldest languages in history.
