                    The reason I would want to visit rome is becuase of its rich historical value and its ancient warfare political strategies.The other thing about rome is that it is very religious city and they have a Pope some kind of holy religious leader who many nations look up to.

                    The reason I would want to learn latin is because if you would learn 
                    latin you would be able to understand some of the European languages
